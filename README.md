## Description

Project developed in the "Maratona JS 3", with Emerson Broga. This application induces the user to train his typing: the typed characters will be stored until the user hits the typing of the current word, and when this occurs, a new word is displayed to perform the same procedure. The words typed correctly will be registered on the side.
